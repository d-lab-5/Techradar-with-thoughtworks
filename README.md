# Map out a tech strategy
Adopted from https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq-and-more 
## The quadrants 
.. are a categorization of the type of blips:
A blip is a technology or technique that plays a role in software development. Blips are things that are ‘in motion’ — that is we find their position in the Radar is changing - usually indicating that we’re finding increasing confidence in them as they move through the rings.

|Quadrant|Description |
|---|---|
|Programming Languages and Frameworks|This was just languages but we rolled frameworks into here with the October 2012 Radar.|
|Tools|hese can be components, such as databases, software development tools, such as versions control systems; or more generic categories of tools, such as the notion of polyglot persistence.   |  
|Platforms  |Things that we build software on top of such as mobile technologies like Android, virtual platforms like the JVM, or generic kinds of platforms like hybrid clouds.   |
|Techniques |These include elements of a software development process, such as experience design; and ways of structuring software, such as microservices. |

It does not need to be perfect. Quadrants are just a way to break up the Radar into topic areas. 

# The rings
The Radar has four rings, which we'll describe starting from the middle:

|Ring|Description |
|---|---|
|The Adopt ring|represents blips that we consider using. We don't say that you should use these for every project; any tool should only be used in an appropriate context. However we do think that a blip in the Adopt ring represents something where there's no doubt that it's proven and mature for use. |
|The Trial ring|is for blips that we think are ready for use, but not as completely proven as those in the Adopt ring. So for most organizations we think you should use these on a trial basis, to decide whether they should be part of your toolkit. Typically we've used trial blips in production, but we realize that readers are more cautious than us. |
|The Assess ring |are things to look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet - unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you. Typically, blips in the Assess ring are things that we think are interesting and worth keeping an eye on.|
The Hold ring | is for things that, even though they are accepted in the industry, we haven't had a good experience with. Therefore we are calling them out to warn you that you may run into trouble with them as well. Sometimes it means we think they're irredeemably flawed; or just being misused. We do place things in the Hold ring that we wish the industry wouldn't use.|
